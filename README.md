The theme of this game was the process that food goes from when it is produced until it reaches home.

It consists of two scenes, the first one seeing how the food arrives at the store in a truck, consists of the food not hitting the walls of the truck while it is moving.
The second scene consists of making the purchase in the supermarket.
